Welcome to the "Machine Learning With Python" repository! This repository is a comprehensive collection of scripts and notebooks dedicated to the exploration and application of various machine learning algorithms, ranging from fundamental techniques to advanced methodologies. The repository is structured into two main sections: "ML Fundamentals" and "ML Advanced."

Repository Structure
ML Fundamentals: This folder contains introductory and foundational scripts and notebooks in machine learning. Here, you will find implementations of basic machine learning algorithms, including different types of regression and classification models. This section is perfect for those who are new to machine learning or wish to revise basic concepts.

ML Advanced: In this folder, you will discover more sophisticated machine learning techniques. This includes scripts utilizing advanced algorithms and frameworks such as Keras, along with methodologies like k-means clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). This section is tailored for individuals who are looking to dive deeper into complex machine learning concepts and applications.
